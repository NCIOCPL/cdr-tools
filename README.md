# CDR Tools

This repository contains utility scripts, most of which are intended
for manual execution from the command-line. The subddirectories are

* [Bin](Bin) - scripts and binary programs which are always in the command
search path (such as the script to fix Windows file permissions); run by
developers on the lower tiers and CBIIT staff on the upper tiers

* [Build](Build) - scripts for creating and deploying CDR releases
* [DevTools](DevTools) - scripts used by the CDR developers for generating
reports, analyzing data, installing filters and schemas, and other such
routine tasks
* [Utilities](Utilities) - other miscellaneous scripts (should probably
be consolidated into the other directories in this repository)
